## Understanding Discord Bots
  Discord bots are popular methods of creating automations for a certain Discord guild. They're programmed applications that reply to interactions pointed at them.
      The average discord bot uses prefixes! They're characters or quick words that tell the bot "Hey there bud, this one's for you!" that are added before a command name. Most common prefixes are: ">" "!" "?" "." and "&" 

What's needed to create and run a Discord bot? 
Well, first off you need a way to create the bot, both in terms of the bot in itself and it's code. To create the bot's profile, check out: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Whether it's via SBM or making your own (with libraries such as discord.js, discord.py etc), you'll always have to host the bot. Applications like "BotGhost" ( some sort of discord bot maker, but with little to no customization in terms of bot functionality) host it for you, but there's tradeoffs to it, unless you pay for it! Let's list off what we need for now:
- The bot in itself
- The bot's code 
### Reccomended Hosts 
- A way to host the bot (Strongly Reccomended: [Phantom Hosting](https://phantom-hosting.net/store/software-hosting))  (Other Bot Hosts (Low-End, Slow): [BOTSHARD - Free](https://botshard.com/) |  | [Bot-Hosting.net](https://bot-hosting.net/) | [Vexy Host](https://vexyhost.com/free-hosting/discord/))

### If you're here then I already know you're going to create the bot via SBM, welcome to the team! ðŸ’–

Look to the left, you may see two panes ordered top to bottom - the top one is the group picker, and the bottom one is the action viewer
