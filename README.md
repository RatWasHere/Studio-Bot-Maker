### **🐛 A no code discord bot maker!**

### Sooo... what is Studio Bot Maker?
~~Isn't it obvious~~ Right... SBM (Studio Bot Maker) is a complete rival to other paid alternatives on Steam, with the benefit of knowing everything is tested before release (except actions sometimes, there's only me workin on this thing & I don't have all the time in the world! 🥲) 
The benefits of that are quite obvious: The end product is a well polished application with a great taste in looks. ~~(maybe not)~~

### 🪚 What to expect whilst using SBM
A visually overwhelming pleasure! You have no idea how much fine tuning went into every single little animation (seriously, I wasted like 10 days fine tuning each one of them, excepting the new ones) and the UI is ~~very human~~ very easy to understand once you get the hang of it! 
Right.. regarding ease of use: It might seem like overcomplicated burning garbage (you gotta see the first iteration of it then 🥰). I swear it ain't at all, ~~trust me bro~~ 
As of now, there's currently 70 actions! Diversity at it's finest ✨

### 💮 Future of SBM 
Whilst development seems slow (and hopefully steady!), SBM has much more going on under the hood each release that comes! Whilst not always performance updates, each update targets to improve Studio Bot Maker's performance by ~3% each time, by removing dead code and useless loops, synchronously adding tons more features, and usually way rounder edges to everything (double meanings, i meant: making everything feel way polished and finished) 

### 👯‍♂️ Aim of general experience 
Studio Bot Maker isn't the most appealing app compared to [Discord Bot Maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/682130/Discord_Bot_Maker/) and [Discord Bot Builder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1119570/Discord_Bot_Builder/), but it's got some killer features over them! (although, kudos to the creator of Discord Bot Builder, since the developer of Discord Bot Maker wants to discontinue the app), guess the release of SBM will be just the right sign for the creator of Discord Bot Maker and every other bot maker app creator to retire! (Though, no pressure guys, finish up support for discord.js v14 first 😅 (Reminder SBM runs discord.js v14.8))
I guess we've just got to wait to see what happens in the future, as SBM is evolving steadily, but I sure as heck hope you have a good feeling about this app too!

### 🫡 Warning
Studio Bot Maker requires significant brain usage, please do not complain the app is hard to use unless you tried using your brain a tad 🥲
