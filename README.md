# Studio Bot Maker

Time to ditch _**Discord Bot Maker**_ and _**Bot Studio For Discord**_ - and whatever other app you're using, move on to something modern, something fluid and fast! Are you ready to move on from the old and the ugly to something more lively, something with personality and great fluidity? Just hit [download](https://github.com/RatWasHere/Studio-Bot-Maker/releases/latest)!

## 🐛 No-Code **Free** Discord Bot Maker!

Skip the hassle of coding! A easy to navigate code free editor to build simple or complex Discord bots.

## 🤔 Sooo... what is Studio Bot Maker?

Well, first off - it's a free app that creates Discord Bots without you needing to write a single line of code!

It has plenty of actions and features making your Bot's development fast and easier than ever - with a bold mindset that aims for a polished and smooth application - every neat thing there is out there!

### What does it have to offer, why would I pick this over a random Discord Bot?

🙃 Say less, here's a few reasons:

- One size doesn't fit all! You can't create a truly "universal" Discord Bot - every community & user has different needs and biases - you might like a Bot with a few, but advanced commands - or, you might like a Bot with plenty of features but not as advanced - choices are endless how you wish your Bot be, as Studio Bot Maker provides all that flexibility easily!
- Ease of use - You pre-configure it for yourself, afterall! Everything is at your mouse cursor, therefore you don't need to go through the boring setups of other Bots, and instead pre-configure everything for yourself! There's no need to rely on anybody else, as you, yourself, can be the master of your Bot!
- It's plenty of fun - You couldn't believe how easy it is to kill time making Discord Bots - especially without code! It's something that gets your brain's cogwheels spinnin' and starts up your creativity - The sky is the limit!
- It's your creation and it's not going anywhere - whatever you create could make for a great showcase subject!

Well, what is it not? First off, it's not a _completed_ application (yet) - but it's got plenty to offer - everything for free!
To continue that, it's not anything special - it's just a simple webapp, but trust me when I say it's performance is superior!
