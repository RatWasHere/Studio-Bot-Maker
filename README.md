Time to ditch _**Discord Bot Maker**_ and _**Bot Studio For Discord**_ - and whatever other app you're using, move on to something modern, something fluid and fast! Are you ready to move on from the old and the ugly to something more lively, something with personality and great fluidity? Just hit [download](https://github.com/RatWasHere/Studio-Bot-Maker/releases/latest)!

(If you're a BotGhost or some other Bot-making website user, this is the exactly the holy piece of gold you were searching for)

  

## üêõ No-Code **Free** Discord Bot Maker!

  

Skip the hassle of coding! A easy to navigate code free editor to build simple or complex Discord bots.

  

## ü§î Sooo... what is Studio Bot Maker?

  

Well, first off - it's a free app that creates Discord Bots without you needing to write a single line of code!

  

It has plenty of actions and features making your Bot's development fast and easier than ever - with a bold mindset that aims for a polished and smooth application - every neat thing there is out there!

  

### What does it have to offer, why would I pick this over a random Discord Bot?

  

üôÉ Say less, here's a few reasons:
- One size doesn't fit all! You can't create a truly "universal" Discord Bot - every community & user has different needs and biases - you might like something simple with a few commands here and there, OR A MONSTER WITH 100 COMMANDS, AND THE OCCASIONAL ABILITY TO CURSE OUT SOMEBODY.

- Ease of use - You pre-configure it for yourself, afterall! Everything is at your mouse cursor, therefore you don't need to go through the boring setups of other Bots! Everything is already set up your way, with your rules!

- It's plenty of fun - You couldn't believe how easy it is to kill time making Discord Bots - especially without code! It's something that gets your brain's cogwheels spinnin' and starts up your creativity - The sky is the limit!

- It's your creation and it's not going anywhere - any bot made in Studio Bot Maker is unlicensed, you have **full** permission to sell your bot!

- Studio Bot Maker is customizable! Everything from the colors, to where the separator in actions is placed, to the action search view, it can be modified through settings!
  

Well, what is it not? First off, it's not a _completed_ application (yet) - but it's got plenty to offer - everything for free!

To continue that, it's not anything special - it's just a simple webapp, but trust me when I say it's performance is superior!
